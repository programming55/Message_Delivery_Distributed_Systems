Using FIFO order of channel
Processes Requests with Timestamp and process (Tsi,i)
(1, 'Node4')
(1, 'Node2')
(3, 'Node1')
(1, 'Node6')
(2, 'Node3')
(1, 'Node5')

Correct Order of processes to execute critical section is:
Node2
Node4
Node5
Node6
Node3
Node1

Actual Order of processes to execute critical section is:
Executing critical section of Node2
Exiting critical section of Node2
Executing critical section of Node4
Exiting critical section of Node4
Executing critical section of Node5
Exiting critical section of Node5
Executing critical section of Node6
Exiting critical section of Node6
Executing critical section of Node3
Exiting critical section of Node3
Executing critical section of Node1
Exiting critical section of Node1


Using Arbitrary order of channel
Processes Requests with Timestamp and process (Tsi,i)
(1, 'Node5')
(1, 'Node2')
(1, 'Node3')
(1, 'Node6')
(1, 'Node1')
(1, 'Node4')

Correct Order of processes to execute critical section is:
Node1
Node2
Node3
Node4
Node5
Node6

Actual Order of processes to execute critical section is:
Executing critical section of Node1
Exiting critical section of Node1
Executing critical section of Node2
Exiting critical section of Node2
Executing critical section of Node3
Exiting critical section of Node3
Executing critical section of Node4
